Build Data Architect mindset
🗓️ 30-Day Data Architect Mindset Training Plan

🔹 Week 1: Foundations of Architect Thinking

Goal: Transition from “how to build” → “why & what to design”.
	•	Day 1: Read Azure Well-Architected Framework (focus on cost, security, performance pillars). → Write one-page notes on how these apply to a data platform.
	•	Day 2: Pick your current project. Write “business goals → architecture choices → trade-offs”.
	•	Day 3: Learn Data Lakehouse vs. Data Warehouse vs. Data Mesh. → Document pros/cons in your own words.
	•	Day 4: Diagram a simple retail analytics architecture (POS + e-commerce → Lakehouse → BI).
	•	Day 5: Review Azure governance tools (Purview, RBAC, Private Endpoints). → Make a checklist for securing pipelines.
	•	Day 6: Watch 1 Databricks Lakehouse architecture talk (Databricks YouTube).
	•	Day 7: Write your first Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for one tech choice you’ve made before.

🔹 Week 2: End-to-End Platform Design

Goal: Think in “full pipeline” blocks, not just pipelines.
	•	Day 8: Study ingestion patterns: batch (ADF, Copy Activity), streaming (Event Hub + Spark).
	•	Day 9: Hands-on: design a streaming pipeline for real-time order processing.
	•	Day 10: Study storage layers: Bronze, Silver, Gold (Delta Lake Medallion).
	•	Day 11: Hands-on: design data model for sales (fact + dimension, with SCD2).
	•	Day 12: Learn CI/CD for data platforms (Azure DevOps pipelines + Databricks notebooks).
	•	Day 13: Diagram full pipeline for banking fraud detection (streaming + ML + BI).
	•	Day 14: Write risks + mitigations for the above design.

🔹 Week 3: Governance, Scalability, Trade-offs

Goal: Develop judgment around enterprise topics.
	•	Day 15: Study data governance (catalogs, lineage, PII handling). Document best practices.
	•	Day 16: Explore performance tuning in Spark (partitioning, AQE, caching). → Write when each should be used.
	•	Day 17: Learn cloud cost optimization (Databricks cluster autoscaling, Synapse reserved). → Note trade-offs.
	•	Day 18: Draw architecture for IoT manufacturing (millions of sensor events → Lakehouse → ML → Power BI).
	•	Day 19: List trade-offs between Synapse vs. Databricks vs. Snowflake.
	•	Day 20: Hands-on: implement a merge/upsert pipeline in Delta Lake (idempotent).
	•	Day 21: Mentor session: review one teammate’s pipeline, but comment only on architecture & design (not code).

⸻

🔹 Week 4: Enterprise Architect Mode

Goal: Think like a leader, not just a builder.
	•	Day 22: Read about compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA) → Write how to handle sensitive data in Azure.
	•	Day 23: Document a multi-region DR design for data platform.
	•	Day 24: Prepare an architecture HLD deck (5 slides) for retail analytics platform.
	•	Day 25: Role-play: answer an interview-style scenario: “How would you migrate Oracle DW → Lakehouse?” (2–3 min script).
	•	Day 26: Case study: Telecom churn prediction (data sources, ML, BI). Draw architecture + risks.
	•	Day 27: Prepare reference architecture templates you can reuse (Ingestion, Governance, Serving).
	•	Day 28: Teach your team one session on Data Modeling + Governance.

⸻

🔹 Week 5 (Final 2 Days): Architect Self-Test
	•	Day 29: Do a mock architecture interview: 3 scenarios (Retail, Finance, IoT). Answer in trade-off style.
	•	Day 30: Create your personal Architecture Portfolio:
	•	3–4 architecture diagrams
	•	2 ADRs
	•	1 case study (end-to-end HLD with risks & mitigations)

This portfolio can be shown in interviews 🚀

⸻

✅ By the end of 30 days, you’ll have:
	•	Architect-level thinking (trade-offs, governance, cost awareness).
	•	A small portfolio of diagrams, ADRs, and case studies.
	•	Confidence to answer interview questions in 2–3 min scripts.
