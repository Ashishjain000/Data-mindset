âœ… Reviewed Checklist (with improvements)
	1.	Use Private Endpoints
	â€¢	Ensure all data services (ADLS, Synapse, Databricks, Key Vault, etc.) are connected via private endpoints.
	â€¢	Block internet routing for sensitive services.
	2.	Disable Public Access
	â€¢	Disable anonymous/public access to storage accounts, databases, and APIs.
	â€¢	Use firewall rules and VNet integration.
	3.	Fine-Grained Access Control (Principle of Least Privilege)
	â€¢	Use RBAC & ACLs to restrict access only to required identities.
	â€¢	Regularly review access.
	4.	Encryption at Rest & In Transit
	â€¢	At rest: Use service-managed keys (default) or customer-managed keys (CMK).
	â€¢	In transit: Enforce TLS 1.2+.
	5.	Data Masking / Tokenization
	â€¢	Use dynamic data masking or tokenization for sensitive PII/PCI data.
	6.	Row-Level & Column-Level Security
	â€¢	Apply policies for multi-tenant or sensitive datasets.
	â€¢	Test for performance impact.
	7.	Secrets & Credentials Management via Key Vault
	â€¢	Store all connection strings, SAS tokens, service principals, and certificates in Key Vault.
	â€¢	Rotate keys/secrets regularly.

ðŸ”’ Additional Security Controls (recommended to add)
	8.	Audit & Monitoring
	â€¢	Enable diagnostic logs and activity monitoring (Azure Monitor, Sentinel, Purview).
	â€¢	Detect anomalies (e.g., unusual data exfiltration).
	9.	Identity & Authentication
	â€¢	Use Managed Identities for services (ADF, Databricks, Synapse).
	â€¢	Enforce MFA for users.
	10.	Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

	â€¢	Implement Purview or Microsoft Information Protection to classify sensitive data.

	11.	Network Security

	â€¢	Use VNet injection for Databricks and Synapse.
	â€¢	Restrict outbound internet access.

	12.	Pipeline Hardening

	â€¢	Validate input/output data (avoid malicious payloads).
	â€¢	Use separate environments (Dev/Test/Prod) with strict boundaries.
